![Dannys Diner](https://github.com/Karishma-Yadav-11/1.SQL-CASE-STUDY-1-Dannys-Diner/blob/main/1.png)

## Introduction
Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.
Danny’s Diner is in need of your assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but have no idea how to use their data to help them run the business.
## Problem Statement
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.
He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.
Danny has provided you with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues - but he hopes that these examples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!
Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:
•	sales
•	menu
•	members

**Dataset:**
```sql
CREATE SCHEMA dannys_diner;
SET search_path = dannys_diner;

CREATE TABLE sales (
  "customer_id" VARCHAR(1),
  "order_date" DATE,
  "product_id" INTEGER
);

INSERT INTO sales
  ("customer_id", "order_date", "product_id")
VALUES
  ('A', '2021-01-01', '1'),
  ('A', '2021-01-01', '2'),
  ('A', '2021-01-07', '2'),
  ('A', '2021-01-10', '3'),
  ('A', '2021-01-11', '3'),
  ('A', '2021-01-11', '3'),
  ('B', '2021-01-01', '2'),
  ('B', '2021-01-02', '2'),
  ('B', '2021-01-04', '1'),
  ('B', '2021-01-11', '1'),
  ('B', '2021-01-16', '3'),
  ('B', '2021-02-01', '3'),
  ('C', '2021-01-01', '3'),
  ('C', '2021-01-01', '3'),
  ('C', '2021-01-07', '3');
 

CREATE TABLE menu (
  "product_id" INTEGER,
  "product_name" VARCHAR(5),
  "price" INTEGER
);

INSERT INTO menu
  ("product_id", "product_name", "price")
VALUES
  ('1', 'sushi', '10'),
  ('2', 'curry', '15'),
  ('3', 'ramen', '12');
  

CREATE TABLE members (
  "customer_id" VARCHAR(1),
  "join_date" DATE
);

INSERT INTO members
  ("customer_id", "join_date")
VALUES
  ('A', '2021-01-07'),
  ('B', '2021-01-09');
```

## Case Study Questions
Each of the following case study questions can be answered using a single SQL statement:
1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?

```sql
SELECT s.customer_id, SUM(price) AS Total_amount_spent
FROM sales s
LEFT JOIN menu m
ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP  BY s.customer_id
ORDER BY s.customer_id;
```

2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?

```sql
SELECT customer_id, count(DISTINCT(order_date)) AS Num_visit_days
FROM sales
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id;
```

3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?

```sql
WITH cte AS
(
SELECT s.customer_id, m.product_name,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY order_date) AS row_num
FROM sales s
JOIN menu m
ON s.product_id = m.product_id
ORDER BY s.customer_id
)

SELECT customer_id, product_name
FROM cte
WHERE row_num = 1;
```

4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?

```sql
SELECT m.product_name,count(s.product_id) AS order_count
FROM  menu m
JOIN sales s
ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY m.product_name
ORDER BY order_count DESC;
```

5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?

```sql
WITH item_count AS
(
SELECT s.customer_id, m.product_name, count(*) AS order_count,
DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY count(*) DESC) AS rnk
FROM sales s
JOIN menu m
ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY s.customer_id, m.product_name
)

SELECT customer_id, product_name
FROM item count
WHERE rnk = 1;
```

6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?

```sql
WITH cte AS
(
SELECT s.customer_id, m.product_name AS order_item_after_membership, s.order_date, mm.join_date,
DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.order_date) AS rnk
FROM sales s
JOIN menu m
ON s.product_id = m.product_id
JOIN members mm
ON s.customer_id = mm.customer_id
WHERE s.order_date > mm.join_date
)

SELECT customer_id, order_item_after_membership
FROM cte
WHERE rnk = 1;
```

7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?

```sql
WITH cte AS
(
SELECT s.customer_id, m.product_name AS order_item_before_membership, s.order_date, mm.join_date,
DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.order_date DESC) AS rnk
FROM sales s
JOIN menu m
ON s.product_id = m.product_id
JOIN members mm
ON s.customer_id = mm.customer_id
WHERE s.order_date < mm.join_date
)

SELECT customer_id, order_item_before_membership
FROM cte
WHERE rnk = 1;
```

8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?

```sql
SELECT s.customer_id, COUNT(s.product_id) AS total_items, SUM(m.price) AS total_amount_spent
FROM sales s
JOIN menu m
ON s.product_id = m.product_id
JOIN members mm
ON s.customer_id = mm.customer_id
WHERE s.order_date < mm.join_date
GROUP BY s.customer_id
ORDER BY s.customer_id;
```

9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?

```sql
WITH cte AS
(
SELECT s.customer_id, m.product_name, m.price,
		CASE
			WHEN m.product_name = 'sushi' THEN m.price*10*2
			ELSE m.price*10
		END AS points
FROM sales s
JOIN menu m
ON s.product_id = m.product_id
)

SELECT customer_id, SUM(points) AS total_points
FROM cte
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id;
```

10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?

```sql
WITH points_cet AS
(
SELECT s.customer_id, m.product_name, m.price, s.order_date,
		CASE
			WHEN s.order_date BETWEEN mm.join_date AND mm.join_date + INTERVAL '7 DAYS' THEN m.price*10*2
			ELSE m.price*10
		END AS points
FROM sales s
JOIN menu m
ON s.product_id = m.product_id
JOIN members mm
ON s.customer_id = mm.customer_id
WHERE s.order_date < '2021-02-01'
)

SELECT customer_id, SUM(points) AS total_points_for_members
FROM points_cet
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id;
```
    
## Bonus Questions
11. Join All The Things
The following questions are related creating basic data tables that Danny and his team can use to quickly derive insights without needing to join the underlying tables using SQL.
(Determine the name and price of the product ordered by each customer on all order dates and find out whether the customer was a member on the order date or not.)

```sql
SELECT s.customer_id, s.order_date, m.product_name, m.price,
		CASE
			WHEN mb.join_date <= s.order_date THEN 'Y'
			ELSE 'N'
		END AS member
FROM sales s
LEFT JOIN members mb
ON s.customer_id = mb.customer_id
JOIN menu m
ON s.product_id = m.product_id;
```

12. Rank All The Things
Danny also requires further information about the ranking of customer products, but he purposely does not need the ranking for non-member purchases so he expects null ranking values for the records when customers are not yet part of the loyalty program.
(Rank the previous output from Q.11 based on the order_date for each customer. display NULL if customer was not a member when dish was ordered.)

```sql
WITH cte AS
(
SELECT s.customer_id, s.order_date, m.product_name, m.price,
		CASE
			WHEN mb.join_date <= s.order_date THEN 'Y'
			ELSE 'N'
		END AS member_status
FROM sales s
LEFT JOIN members mb
ON s.customer_id = mb.customer_id
JOIN menu m
ON s.product_id = m.product_id
)

SELECT *,
		CASE
			WHEN member_status= 'Y' THEN RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id, member_status ORDER BY order_date)
			ELSE NULL
		END AS ranking
FROM cte;
```
